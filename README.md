* Your friend would then paste the Group ID, and click `Join`
* You are now both in the same group!

### Sharing your Items
* The plugin can only record items that it has actually seen when you are logged in
* This applies to your `Inventory`, `Equipment`, `Bank`, and `Group Storage`
* On first time installing this plugin, simply open your `Bank` and click the `Sync Button` ![image info](./src/main/resources/screenshots/sync-icon.png)
* The `Sync Button` will manually save your items for other players in your group to see
* Your items will also be saved automatically every 10 minutes

### Viewing others' Items
* To view other player items, simply select the player from the dropdown
