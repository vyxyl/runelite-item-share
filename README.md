## Using the Plugin

### Installation
* Install the Item Share plugin from the Runelite Plugin Hub

* At this stage you are automatically assigned to a group with only yourself as a member

### Joining a group
* You can either invite players to your group or join someone else's group
* In either case, if you click the `Settings Button` ![image info](https://github.com/vyxyl/runelite-item-share-resources/blob/main/settings-icon.png)

* Your friend would then paste the Group ID, and click `Join`
* You are now both in the same group!

### Sharing your Items
* The plugin will automatically share your items with players in your group every 10 minutes
    * However, it will only share items that the plugin _**has actually viewed**_
    * This applies to your `Inventory`, `Equipment`, `Bank`, and `GIM Storage`

* On the first time installing this plugin, simply open your `Bank` and click the `Sync Button` ![image info](https://github.com/vyxyl/runelite-item-share-resources/blob/main/sync-icon.png)

* The `Sync Button` will manually save your items for other players in your group to see

### Viewing others' Items
* To view other player items, simply select the player from the dropdown

### Sync Button

* The `Sync Button` ![image info](https://github.com/vyxyl/runelite-item-share-resources/blob/main/sync-icon.png) is pretty multipurpose
  * Saves your items for other players to see
  * Updates the dropdown with any new players that have joined your group
  * Reloads the items for the currently selected player

### GIM Storage
* You can enable the GIM Storage item tab from your settings, by checking `Enable GIM Storage`

* Note: only **one** GIM Storage is saved per group
* If multiple players belong to different GIM groups, then the last saved storage will be visible

### Misc.
